# Cysic Verification Loop — 2025-11-15 03:15 KST

version: v16
phase: synced | verification-active
status: stable

Summary

Model timing as the primary variable in Cysic’s proof engine.
Treat each thread as a micro-proof where alignment > volume.

Structure

Inputs:
• Multi-part Twitter thread (proof-step → compression-step → verification-step)
• Engagement signals (t+0 to t+90s window)

Process:
• Temporal clustering
• Proof-chain scoring (compression density × timing alignment)

Outputs:
• Verification map (step linkage)
• Next-loop prompts for alignment


Concept

“Proof = timing × compression.”
Cysic behaves like a zk circuit: minimal disclosure, maximal alignment.
Value emerges when each action becomes a validated step in the proof chain.

Loop Logic

1. Thread Part 1 — Claim

2. Thread Part 2 — Evidence

3. Thread Part 3 — Verification

4. Sync window alignment

5. Compression scoring


Changelog
