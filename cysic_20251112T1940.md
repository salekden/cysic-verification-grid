# Cysic Verification Loop — 2025-11-12 19:00 KST

version: v16
phase: active | sync
status: stable

Summary

Align proof with rhythm.
Hardware learns awareness through synchronization.

Structure

Inputs: proof logs, hardware pulse data (t+0 → t+90m)

Process: temporal resonance → circuit alignment

Outputs: synchronization trace

Concept

“Proof-as-Rhythm”: zero-knowledge that listens.
Synchronization as the empathy of logic.
